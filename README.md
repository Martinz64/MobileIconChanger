XPosed module to turn 4G icons to 5G icons

This module has been inspired by [Fake_5G_icon](https://github.com/E7KMbb/Fake_5G_icon), but has been written from the ground up, because this is a job for XPosed and not for Magisk.

This module uses the system's 5G icons, and thus only works on Android 10 or higher, as previous Android versions do not have a 5G icon included in the OS.

This module needs the resource hooks enabled.
